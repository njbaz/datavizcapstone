    <h2>Tool #1: California by Zip Code</h2>
    <p>Use this dashboard to explore and analyze district performance trends, learning loss, recovery, and demographic data. The first section provides a visual timeline of scores from 2016 to 2023, showing how performance compares to the national 5th-grade average and highlighting changes over time, including the impact of COVID-19. The second section focuses on learning loss between 2019 and 2022, followed by partial recovery through 2023, offering insights into academic progress. The third section offers a district profile, including racial demographics, minority enrollment levels, district size, and free lunch eligibility. Users can filter by district and subject (Math or Reading Language Arts) to tailor the data to their specific needs. This tool is designed to help stakeholders assess academic performance, track recovery efforts, and better understand the districtâ€™s student population.</p>

    <h2>Tool #2: District Dashboard</h2>
<p>This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of district-level performance, focusing on academic scores, learning loss, and recovery trends. Users can analyze performance data by selecting a specific district and subject, enabling customized views of educational outcomes. Section #1 visualizes scores by year, showing changes relative to national averages and assigning letter grades for clarity. Section #2 highlights learning loss during the pandemic (2019-2022) and subsequent recovery efforts (2022-2023) using bar charts for quick comparisons.
<br><br>
    In Section #3, users can explore demographic profiles, including race/ethnicity breakdowns, minority enrollment, and economic indicators like free lunch eligibility. A district map provides geographic context, while percentile rankings help benchmark performance against other California districts. This snapshot allows educators, administrators, and policymakers to identify trends, pinpoint gaps, and evaluate recovery efforts to guide data-driven decisions.</p>
