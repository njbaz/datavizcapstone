  <h3>About this Project</h3>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped education, causing significant disruptions in student performance, particularly in standardized testing. In California, these disruptions deepened existing disparities, with some students recovering more quickly than others. While tools like the Education Opportunity Project provide valuable insights, accessing and interpreting this data can be challenging.
  <br><br>
  This platform is designed to bridge that gap. It offers an interactive and narrative-driven experience, presenting district-level data across California to highlight disparities in educational recovery. Our goal is to empower educators, administrators, and policymakers with accessible tools to understand these trends and allocate resources effectively to support students.</p>
  <br><br>

  <ul>
      <li>Educators and Administrators: Explore recovery trajectories in your district to make informed decisions that support student success.</li>
      <li>Policymakers: Access data-driven insights to design equitable policies addressing disparities in education recovery.</li>
      <li>Researchers and Social Scientists: Investigate the long-term effects of the pandemic on student outcomes and demographic groups using synthesized data and visualizations.
