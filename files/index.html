    <!-- About this Project -->
  <h3>About this Project</h3>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped education, causing significant disruptions in student performance, particularly in standardized testing. In California, these disruptions deepened existing disparities, with some students recovering more quickly than others. While tools like the <a href="https://edopportunity.org/" target=blank">Educational Opportunity Project</a> provide valuable insights and lay significant groundwork, accessing and interpreting this data can be challenging.
  <br><br>
  This platform is designed to bridge that gap. It offers an interactive and context-focused experience, presenting both state and district-level data across California to highlight disparities in educational recovery. The goal is to empower educators, administrators, and policymakers with accessible tools to understand these trends and allocate resources effectively to support students in their ongoing recovery.</p>
