      <p>This project provided an initial exploration of pandemic-related learning trends but was limited in scope. Future steps include analyzing disparities within districts, exploring subject-specific trends in math and ELA, and examining regional differences between rural and urban areas. Incorporating statistical significance, causal explanations, and cross-referencing with datasets like relief funding and school closures will provide a more comprehensive understanding of recovery efforts.

        <h2>01:  Perform More Analyses Within-District</h2>
        <p>Using SEDA data, analyzing racial group outcomes within districts can uncover disparities in learning loss and recovery. This will help identify localized inequities not visible at broader levels and provide insights for targeted interventions to address these gaps.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-box">
        <h2>02: Take a Deeper Look at Math vs. ELA Trends</h2>
        <p>Further exploring math and ELA trends can clarify how the pandemic uniquely impacted these subjects. Understanding subject-specific gaps will help tailor recovery strategies and inform resource allocation for balanced academic support.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-box">
        <h2>03: Geographical Trends: Rural vs. Urban and Regional Analysis</h2>
        <p>Examining rural, urban, and regional trends can reveal how factors like technology access and infrastructure influenced recovery. Identifying these patterns will offer insights into localized challenges and highlight where targeted resources are needed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-box">
        <h2>04: Explore Significance: Statistical vs. Non-Statistical Differences</h2>
        <p>Analyzing the statistical significance of observed trends will distinguish meaningful differences from random variations. This ensures findings are robust, helping prioritize trends that warrant further investigation and action.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-box">
        <h2>05: Causality: Investigating Potential Causes of Trends</h2>
        <p>Explore these trends from an explanatory point of view by incorporating findings from rigorous studies to identify the causes behind observed correlations. This approach will help connect factors like technology access, socio-economic conditions, and instructional disruptions to learning outcomes, offering a clearer understanding of the drivers behind disparities.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content-box">
        <h2>06: Cross-Reference with Other Datasets</h2>
        <p>Linking SEDA data with datasets on relief funding, school closures, and attendance will provide a broader perspective on recovery. This can reveal which interventions were most effective and guide future resource allocation strategies.
